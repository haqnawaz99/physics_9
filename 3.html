              Newton's Third Law of motion
            </h1>
<p><i><b>Newton’s 3rd law states that there is an equal and opposite reaction for every.</b></i><br>


When two bodies interact, they apply forces on each other that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. To
understand Newton’s third law with the help of an example, let us consider a book resting on a table. The book applies a
downward force equal to its weight on the table. According to the third law of motion, the table applies an equal and
opposite force to the book. This force occurs because the book slightly deforms the table; as a result, the table pushes
back on the book like a coiled spring. Newton’s third law of motion implies the conservation of momentum.
